/*Notes(To-do):
-in-addition to a section dedicated to the maze, there needs to be a option to select one or more algorithms to run at the same time. 
Along with an option to select which traversal mode should be used
-if going to do collectables, need a way to animate the agents movement
*/
/*Plan:
-Set up buttons that activate algorithms when clicked, already set up, just needs guts
x-Make place holders for coding visuals for buttons and maze, done!
-Read through maze to build it as a container(container))
-Then read through algorithm results to then update maze visualizer
--If want to see how algorithm works, get paths that aren't final and display with different visual (phantom)
x-Make sure to display based on size if there are different sized mazes***** DONE!!!!!!!!
*/

/*How to use GUI code:
-Find main or make it? (Don't know how to do that on GitHub)
-In main just have return launch();
-Edit paths to images to work with github
-Tell me if you need me to edit CMake to work with SFML
-And you're done!
-It should work!
